# 🩺 MediSuivi – Medical Tracking Application

## Overview

**MediSuivi** is a **work-in-progress project** originally designed to become a **mobile medical tracking application**.

From the start, the project has been built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** so that it can:
- be installed on smartphones like a native application,
- work offline,
- later evolve into a full mobile application.

The goal of MediSuivi is to help users **track their medications**, **avoid missed doses**, and **manage medical treatments**, while ensuring that all data remains **100% local** on the user’s device.
